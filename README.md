# Unity Pivot Point Tool

Adds a Menu Item into the Unity Editor to Control the Scene-Pivot Point.
This functionality is inspired by the 3DCursor-Feature from blender.

You can Enable & Disable a "Gizmo" to show the Pivot Point with `Shift + Y`.

`Shift + X` resets the Scene's Pivot Point to (0,0,0)!
